	<div class="text">The World Wide Web started early in the 1990s and has grown exponentially since then.<br>
	The Web consists of HTML documents, where hyperlinks connect the pages like a web.<br>
	HTML or hypertext markup language is the code that runs webpages like this one.<br>
	When a person goes to a web page like <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>, their computer sends an HTTP request to a server. <br>
	The server finds the right HTML document, and sends it back to the person's computer to be displayed.<br></div>
</div>

<div class="Tags">
<br>
	<div class="topic"><b>Tags</b><br></div>
	<div class="text">Tags are bits of HTML code that instruct the computer on what to do.<br>
	Many tags have an opening tag and a closing tag, but there are a expections to this rule, such as the<br>
	tag for a line break.<br>
	Tags tell the computer how an HTML document should look.<br></div>
</div>

<div class="elements">
<br>
	<div class="topic"><b>Inline or Block elements</b><br></div>
	<div class="text">Some HTML elements are known as inline because the formatting they create<br>
	appears inline with the text. Other elemetns are block elements because they make<br>	
	an invisible box around the content that is placed inside the tags.<br>
	<br></div>

	<div class="topic"><b>Computers need to be told</b><br></div>
	<div class="text">Computers are stupid in that they need very specific instructions to know what to do.<br>

<div class="Trees">
<br>
	<div class="topic"><b>Tree like structure of HTML</b><br></div>
	<div class="text">HTML is structure a bit like a family tree. My parents had two kids, so there are two boxes underneath my parents box.<br>
	This forms the boxes of the webpage, which is the frame upon which all things on the web are hung. </div>
</div>
<div class="Boxes">
<br>
	<div class="topic"><b>Boxes, not Tubes</b><br></div>
	<div class="text">Everything on the web has a box that it fits into, and these boxes can be moved about on the page like pictures in a scrapbook.<br>
	There is an invisible grid that can be manipulated so make your HTML page look how you want it to look. </div>
</div>
<div class="CSS">
<br>
	<div class="topic"><b>CSS</b><br></div>
	<div class="text">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which give coders a great way to control how their webpage looks.<br>
		By giving similar HTML elements the same class name, the CSS can tell the HTML what style it should use on that class.<br></div>
